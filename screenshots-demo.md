# Markdown Guide

An overview of Markdown, how it works, and what you can do with it.

## What is Markdown?

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

## Why Use Markdown?

Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an interface to format your text? As it turns out, there are several reasons why people use Markdown.

- Markdown can be used for everything. 
- Markdown is portable. 
- Markdown is platform independent.
